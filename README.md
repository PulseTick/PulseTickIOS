# PLSburn iOS App (Formerly PulseTick)
The PLSburn iOS App, officially recognized by PLSburn.com, is a free, open-source tool designed to provide real-time data from PulseChain. Our mission is to facilitate users with a simple and intuitive way to track PulseChain token prices. The app operates without requiring permissions, account creation, or wallet connection, ensuring an effortless and private user experience.

I am devoted to maintaining and enhancing this app to ensure it offers the most accurate and current information possible.

Enjoy using the PLSburn App!
