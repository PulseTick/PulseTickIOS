# PulseTick IOS App
PulseTick is a free, open source, independently developed application dedicated to providing real-time data from PulseChain. My mission is to offer users an easy and intuitive way to track their PulseChain token prices. The app requires no permissions and does not require an account or wallet connection. 

This application is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or directly associated with PulseChain or any of its services. The data provided in this app is sourced directly from publicly available APIs, and is presented for informational purposes only.

I'm dedicated to maintaining and updating this app to ensure it provides the most accurate and up-to-date information possible. The app runs out of a single content view window and reads the token images from the assets folder.

Enjoy using PulseTick!

# Buy Me A Coffee
If you want to buy me a coffee, my Pulse Wallet is 0x6387Fa88E71c16Bf4fc7DA3c03075D211A1FbEc2

This is for coffee only. As per the App Store T&Cs it is not a requirement nor expected. 

Thank You!
